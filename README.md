Indian Recipe Suggestion Web App using Flask
This project is a lightweight, local web application built with Flask that allows users to browse and view a wide range of Indian recipes. Recipes are neatly organized by categories like Curries, Sweets, Snacks, Beverages, and Breakfast. Users can click through categories, select a recipe, and view detailed ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions — all through a clean, browser-based interface.
Instead of using a database, the entire recipe collection is stored directly in Python as dictionaries. This makes the app easy to run, modify, and expand — ideal for beginners learning Flask or for use as a personal offline recipe manager.

Key Features:
Over 100 Indian recipes, including regional favorites
Category-based browsing: Curries, Snacks, Sweets, Breakfast, and more
Each recipe includes ingredients and detailed preparation steps
Runs completely offline — no internet or database setup needed
Simple, beginner-friendly Flask backend and HTML frontend
